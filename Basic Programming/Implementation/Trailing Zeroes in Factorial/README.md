# [Trailing Zeroes in Factorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/implementation/basics-of-implementation/practice-problems/algorithm/trailing-zeroes-in-factorial/)

**Difficulty: Hard**

Mr. Yash asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer *m* and asks for the number of positive integers *n*, such that the factorial of *n* ends with exactly *m* zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?

## Input

First line of input contains an integer *T* number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer *M* &mdash; the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.

## Output

First print *k* &mdash; the number of values of *n* such that the factorial of *n* ends with *m* zeroes. Then print these *k* integers in increasing order.

## Constraints

+ 1 &le; *M* &le; 100,000
