**Difficulty: Medium**

Indian army is going to do a surprise attack on one of its enemies country. The President of India, the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army will be sending an alert message to all its commanding centers. As enemy would be monitoring the message, Indian army is going to encrypt (cipher) the message using basic encryption technique. A decoding key *K* (number) would be sent secretly.

You are assigned to develop a cipher program to encrypt the message. Your cipher must rotate every character in the message by a fixed number making it unreadable by enemies.

The cipher only encrypts alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9). All symbols remain unencrypted.

## Input

First line contains a string *S* that needs to be encrypted. \
Second line contains an integer *N*, denoting the decoding key.

## Output

Encrypt and print the resulting string.

## Constraints

+ 0 &le; *N* &le; 1,000
